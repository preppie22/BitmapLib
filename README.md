# BitmapLib
A C# library with some fast methods to interface between 2D arrays and Bitmaps. This library is still under development. I'll be adding classes and methods as and when I use them in my work.

## Compilation
This library has been built using Visual C# 2017. You can simply open the solution file in Visual Studio and hit Build to get a DLL and XML file.

## Usage
After compiling the code, copy the resulting BitmapLib.dll and BitmapLib.xml files to your project directory. Expand your project tree in the Solution Explorer, right-click on References, and click Add Reference. Click on Browse... at the bottom and open the DLL file to add to your project.

At the top of your project add the line:
```cs
using BitmapLib;
```

## WARNING
This code has NOT been tested extensively enough. Please ensure that you test it before using it in your project.
